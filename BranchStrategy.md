# Branch Strategy
- All work is done in feature branches, which are merged into 'Staging' via Pull request (PR)
- When ready to move into production 'Staging' is merged into 'Main' via PR
- Naming convention: branch is named after the feature developed, or marked as Bugfix/Hotfix
- Before PR branch must be up-to-date
- In PR write a short description of changes suggested
- All communication about suggested changes take place as comments etc. in the PR
- When all questions are resolved one (1) person must approve merge
- When PR is completed branch is deleted ('Staging' excluded)
