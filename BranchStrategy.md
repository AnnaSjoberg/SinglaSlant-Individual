# Branch Strategy
- All work is done in branches, which are merged into Master via Pull requests (PR)
- Naming convention: branch is named after the feature developed, or marked as Bugfix/Hotfix
- Before PR branch must be up-to-date with Master
- In PR write a short description of changes suggested
- All communication about suggested changes take place as comments etc in the PR
- When all questions are resolved one (1) person must approve merge
- When PR is completed branch is deleted
